"""A readiness port that answers only while the worker is a routing target.

The engine's own ``/health`` answers as soon as sglang has loaded its weights,
which is several steps before this worker can take traffic: the PD barrier
still has to move a real KV block, and the registration that makes the router
aware of it has not happened yet. A rollout that retires the previous pod on
``/health`` therefore removes the worker that was serving in favour of one that
is not yet reachable.

This port is opened after registration and closed before deregistration, so
"accepting connections" means the same thing the router means by a live
worker.
