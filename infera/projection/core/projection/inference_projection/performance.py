"""Inference performance projection: prefill + autoregressive decode.

This reuses the existing analytical profiler tree (in *simulation* mode, so
no GPU is required) to estimate **forward-only** per-component latency, then
composes those into the two serving phases:

  * **Prefill** — process the whole prompt (optionally in chunks) to produce
    the first token.  Drives **TTFT** (time-to-first-token).
  * **Decode** — generate ``output_seq_len`` tokens autoregressively, each
    step attending to a growing KV cache.  Drives **ITL / TPOT** and decode
    throughput.

Serving features modelled here: chunked prefill, KV-cache quantization
(via the SDPA/KV dtype), batching / concurrency, and speculative decoding.

# There is deliberately no tuning knob here for how ``implied_fixed_ms``
# behaves across parallelism.
#
# An earlier revision carried one: a fitted exponent applied as
# ``fixed * shard ** exp`` when restoring a chord-fitted anchor at a width it
# was not harvested at. Swept against measured TP8 runs anchored from TP4, the
# per-model optima came out at 0.4, 1.0 and 0.5 -- spread across the whole
# range, so no single value described anything and the number was only ever a
# curve-fit to three models. It has been removed rather than retuned.
#
# What replaced it is a measurement. ``_fit_prefill_curve`` fits
# ``F + a*n + b*n^2`` over four or more probe lengths, which separates the
# per-step fixed cost from per-token work instead of leaving them mixed in a
# two-point chord's intercept. ``F`` is then held across parallelism and the
# per-token terms are sharded, because that is what each one does. The
# decomposition checks out against hardware: solving ``T(n,TP) = F + S(n)/ratio``
# from measured DeepSeek-V4-Pro TP4 and TP8 prefill gives F = 146.90 ms at 4096
# tokens and 145.86 ms at 8192, two independent lengths agreeing to 1%.
#
# When an anchor predates that and carries only a chord, the fallback holds the
# intercept whole -- exponent zero in the old parameterisation. That is the
# physical reading of the quantity's name and it needs no calibration; it is
# also, measurably, not as accurate as the curve, which is why the fallback
# warns and asks for a re-harvest rather than quietly standing in for one.

        to the target's.

        Three laws, in the order they are preferred:

        **The simulator's own ratio** (``origami``, the default). Evaluates a
        prefill step at both widths analytically and moves the measured anchor
        by ``sim(target) / sim(bench)``. The absolute analytical cost is not
        trusted anywhere here -- it is several-fold off -- but it cancels in the
        ratio, leaving a shape that knows what the other two laws cannot: how
        wide each rank's GEMMs end up and what the collectives cost there.

        **A fit through two measured widths**, if a second anchor was supplied.

        **Ideal sharding**, ``bench_tp / tgt_tp``, with a warning.

        Ideal is preferred by neither and is only a floor, because whether it
        holds is a property of the model that one anchor width cannot reveal.
        Measured at TP4 and TP8, DeepSeek's whole prefill step carries at 0.651
        and GLM-5.2-MXFP4's at 0.825 -- GLM barely gains from the extra width at
        all, because its per-token work is MXFP4 expert GEMMs already too narrow
        at TP4 to fill the matrix cores. Against those two:

            law              DeepSeek   GLM-5.2
            ideal sharding     +9.2%     -32.6%
            two-width fit         --     -25.8%
            simulator ratio    -4.4%      -6.9%

        The two-width fit losing to the simulator is not an accident of GLM. Its
        anchors are at TP2 and TP4, and GLM shards at 0.563 between those before
        falling off a cliff to 0.825 above them, so every point the fit can see
        says scaling is healthy. Extrapolating from below the target cannot find
        a breakdown that only happens above it; evaluating the target width
        directly can.

        ``fixed_scale`` is 1.0 for the latter two laws, which shard the
        per-token half and hold the per-step intercept -- right for them,
        because ideal sharding is a statement about per-token compute.

        The simulator's ratio instead applies to **both** halves, and that is
        deliberate and hard-won. The prefill probe separates a step cleanly:
        its slope times the token count reproduces the engine's own prefill
        time to four figures (DeepSeek-V4-Pro at TP4, 46.68 us/tok x 8192 =
        382.4 ms against 382.43 measured), so the slope is engine work and the
        intercept is host and queueing cost outside it. It is tempting to carry
        those two separately, and the simulator will offer a ratio for each.
        Do not: it gets the whole step right and the split wrong.

            DeepSeek-V4-Pro, TP4 -> TP8      simulator   measured
            per-token (engine) work            x0.665     x0.365
            per-step (host) cost               x0.520     x1.630
            whole step                         x0.622     x0.648

        Its per-token work shards *better* than ideal while its host cost rises
        by nearly two thirds, and the simulator has both backwards. The whole
        step survives because the two errors are opposed and cancel. Carrying
        only the per-token half and holding the intercept reads +14.7% here,
        and +20.1% on the earlier whole-prefill observable, against -4.4% for
        the blended ratio.

        Llama-3.1-8B does not contradict this, it merely cannot see it: its
        host cost is 8.06 +/- 2.49 ms across TP1..TP8, about 8% of a step, so
        any split is nearly the same number. Splitting reads +1.6% there
        against +4.9% blended -- a real but small gain, bought at the price of
        +14.7% on a model where the intercept is 22% of the step. And on GLM
        the split costs more still: scored through the scheduler against
        measured TP8 at ISL 1024, the median error goes 18.2% -> 24.4%.

        A split is the right shape and will be worth having once each half can
        be calibrated against something. Neither can today: the engine slope is
        measured only at one sequence per step while the scheduler packs
        sixteen at ISL 1024, and every anchor's batch sweep is derived by
        multiplication rather than measured, so nothing on disk constrains the
        packed regime. That is what ``--prefill-packed-points`` is for.

        ``admit_ms``

            ``decode_admission_steps`` decode steps, so a request that is ready
            mid-window waits the rest of it -- half the window on average.  This
            is real added wall time.

        ``buffered_ms``
            The server flushes the stream only every ``stream_interval`` tokens,
            so the client's first token arrives with the flush that carries it.
            This is *not* added wall time: it moves generation time the client
            already waits out of TPOT and into TTFT, which is why the caller
            deducts it from the decode span rather than adding it to end-to-end

        A serving benchmark run with ``--max-concurrency C`` is a closed

        (``service_ms``, here the prefill) and generating (``think_ms``, the
        decode span, during which the client is not queued for prefill). Exact
        mean-value analysis walks the population up from 1 to ``C``; a request
        arriving into a population of ``k`` sees the queue that ``k-1`` others
        left behind.

        The two limits are the ones that matter. Lightly loaded (long
        generations, short prompts) it returns ``service_ms`` — no queueing.
        Saturated (prompts dominate) it approaches ``C * service_ms - think_ms``,
        the FIFO sweep. Pricing TTFT at either limit alone is wrong by the
        ratio between them, which across Hyperloom's workloads is ~20x.

        ``service_ms`` and ``demand_ms`` are the same number on a FIFO server and
        different ones here, which is the whole reason a continuous-batching
        engine does not behave like a queue of prompts. ``service_ms`` is what
        *my* prefill takes end to end: its chunks ride scheduler steps that are
        also carrying the running decodes, so the elapsed time includes that
        decode work. ``demand_ms`` is what each prompt queued ahead of me adds to
        my wait, which is only its own prefill compute -- those steps were going
        to run for the decode batch whether my prompt existed or not, so their
        decode work and per-step overhead are not a cost my prompt waits for.

        Charging the elapsed step to both roles is what makes the model diverge:
        the decode share grows with the client count, so a queue that should
        grow linearly in ``C`` grows like ``C^2`` and crosses into saturation
        that the real engine never reaches. Defaults to the FIFO reading when no
