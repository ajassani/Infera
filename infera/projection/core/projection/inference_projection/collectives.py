"""Explicit inference communication model (feature B: custom collective ops).

The training profiler folds tensor-parallel AllReduce and expert-parallel
AllToAll *into* the per-layer forward time.  For serving we want comm to be a
first-class, reportable quantity so users can:

  * see a per-phase **communication breakdown** (TP AllReduce, EP AllToAll,
    PP send/recv, and KV-cache transfer for disaggregation),
  * **force a collective algorithm** (ring / one-shot / two-shot /
    hierarchical) instead of the auto-selected fastest,
  * **overlap** comm with compute (a fraction hidden behind GEMMs), and
  * apply a **custom fused-op** speedup (e.g. AllReduce+RMSNorm fusion or
    DeepEP-style overlapped dispatch/combine).

All times are returned in **milliseconds**.  At default knob values this model
reproduces the implicit cost computed inside ``transformer_layer`` so totals
stay consistent; the delta only appears when a knob is changed.

        """Replace the training-scale fixed overhead with the measured intra-node floor.

        The base collective model carries a fixed RCCL overhead calibrated for
        training's very large messages (hundreds of MB), where it is negligible
        next to the transfer.  A graph-captured intra-node serving collective does
        not pay it at any size, so it is stripped and the cost becomes
        ``max(measured latency floor, bandwidth transfer)``: the floor dominates
        the small decode messages the microbenchmark covered, and the bandwidth
        term takes over smoothly as the message grows (prefill-scale messages are
        bandwidth-dominated, so the result is unchanged there).

        Applying this continuously matters: keying it on a message-size crossover
        made the fixed overhead reappear in one step, so a 1.25x larger message
        could cost ~8x more and then stay flat — the constant, not bandwidth, was
        setting the price.

        The all-reduce is measured directly on the kernel vLLM runs, so it uses
        that fit in preference to the training model's bandwidth term.

        Multi-node used to keep the base model whole, on the grounds that its NIC
        overheads are real and were not part of the intra-node measurement. The
        network terms are indeed real and are kept. The *fixed* terms are not:
        RCCL setup is algorithm selection, communicator state and the kernel
        launch chain, which is host-side work that does not know whether a peer
        is across the node or across the room. Intra-node measurement prices that
        same work at about 10 us; the training-calibrated constant charges 200,
        plus a 260 us NIC warmup adder for messages below 32 MB. A decode message
        is a couple of MB and a step runs one per layer, so on a 48-layer model
        that was 22 ms of fixed cost per token -- and it never amortises, because
        the adder is charged again on every step of a stream that has already
        moved gigabytes through a warm communicator.

        The visible effect was that TP16 projected 6.5x slower than TP8 for the
        same model, which would have told a Hyperloom search never to go
        multi-node. Note this path remains the least validated part of the model:
        there is no inter-node inference measurement in the artifact set, so the
        network terms here are analytical where the intra-node ones are measured.
