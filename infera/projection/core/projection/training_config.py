    launch, memory latency, drain -- which is paid on top of the data movement
    a profiler times, not instead of it. Restricting the count to the

    # of 2.93, 2.56, 2.57, 2.82 ms at TP=1,2,4,8 -- flat, as a fixed cost should
    # be, since sharding does not remove kernels. So the floor is that mean,
    # 2.72 ms, and a small all-reduce now contributes only its bandwidth term,
    # its own occupancy already being one of the kernels counted here.
    #
    # What is calibrated is the *product* of a kernel count and a per-kernel
    # minimum, and only the product was measured. Splitting it wrongly does not
    # show up on the model it was fitted to and does show up on every other one:
    # gpt-oss runs about 15 kernels in a decode layer, so the same 2.72 ms is
    # 4.98 us across ``36 * 15 + 6 = 546`` kernels rather than being spread over
    # an assumed 438. DeepSeek-R1 runs about 23 -- MLA splits the attention
    # projections and a shared expert adds a third GEMM pair -- and at 61 layers
    # that difference is worth 1.7 ms of floor, which is most of why its decode
    # step was under-predicted by 31% at batch 4.
    #
    # So the per-layer count is derived from the model architecture
    # (``decode_kernels_per_layer``) and this stays a hardware figure. The way
    # to stop estimating it is to run the sweep above on each GPU architecture
    # being served: time one decode step per tensor-parallel rung with real
    # weights, solve for the intercept, and divide by the kernels that model
    # issues. Until a given architecture has been through that, cross-model
    # agreement is the only test of whether its value is hardware physics or one
    # model's tuning.
    #
    # Being a hardware figure it is also a *per-architecture* one. The number
    # above was solved on mi355x and does not describe gb300: on GLM-5.2 it
    # prices the 1,800 kernels of a decode step at 8.96 ms, where the measured

    # microseconds of TTFT per prompt token, for the stack that produced it.
    #
    # It is an anchor on the *level* of prefill compute, not a replacement for
    # the cost model. Prefill is superlinear in the prompt (attention grows with
    # context) and a slope fit over a short span cannot express that, so applying
    # ``r`` directly would misprice long prompts badly in the other direction.
    # Instead the projector computes its own slope over the same two lengths and
