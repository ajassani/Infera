"""Inference / serving tuning: trial config, legality, seed plan, objectives.

This is the inference-mode counterpart to ``legality.py`` + ``plan.py`` (which
target distributed *training*).  It defines the serving search space — the
knobs that actually move TTFT / inter-token latency / throughput / KV-cache
capacity — and a deterministic seed sweep over them.

The oracle is ``inferasim projection inference`` (see
``infera.projection.core.projection.inference_projection``); the evaluator builds
the command and parses the metrics (see
``evaluator.Evaluator.evaluate_inference``).

Search axes (vs. the training axes):
  * **tp / pp / ep / cp** — serving parallelism (no backward, no optimizer).
  * **batch_size / max_concurrency** — continuous-batching depth (replaces the
    training GBS/MBS/num_microbatches pipeline-fill identity).
  * **weight_dtype / kv_cache_dtype** — weight + KV quantization (fp8/int8).
  * **chunked_prefill_size** — bound prefill latency / enable batching.
  * **speculative_num_tokens / acceptance_rate** — speculative decoding.

Training-only axes (recompute, pipeline-schedule bubble tuning, FSDP2,
distributed optimizer, overlap_grad_reduce, SyncFree) are intentionally absent.
