"""NATS per-instance request transport (Model B) for the infera request path.

This is the dynamo-style alternative to the default direct-HTTP forwarding in
``infera.router.mixed``: the router still *selects* a worker with the unchanged
policy (round-robin / kv-aware), then instead of ``httpx.POST {worker.url}`` it
publishes the request onto that specific worker's NATS subject and streams the
reply back over a reply inbox. Selection/scoring is transport-agnostic, so
kv-aware routing works identically — NATS is only the transport.

Wire protocol (one request -> N reply messages on a fresh inbox):

  request  (server -> ``infera.req.<token(worker_id)>``, reply=<inbox>):
      JSON  {"path": str, "stream": bool, "headers": {..}|null, "body": {..},
             "migratable": bool}

  reply    (worker -> <inbox>), framed by the ``rs-type`` header:
      data : payload = raw response bytes (an SSE chunk, or the full JSON body)
      done : payload = b"" , header ``rs-status`` = HTTP status code
      error: payload = utf-8 error text  (transport/proxy failure)

``migratable`` says the router can continue this generation on another worker
(see infera.router.migration), which is what lets a draining worker hand it back
early instead of holding the shutdown open. It is a promise about the *router*,
so the worker must not assume it: without it, a request is drained the slow way
and severing it early would just be an error the client did not have to see.

The worker side proxies to its own local engine HTTP (127.0.0.1:<port>), so the
engine itself is unchanged; the consumer is a thin task started alongside it
(like the KV relay).

Optional admission throttle (default OFF): set ``INFERA_NATS_REQ_MAX_PENDING``
> 0 on both server and worker pods to make the request path JetStream-backed
(WorkQueue stream ``INFERA_REQUESTS``, one durable consumer per worker). The
router then queries that worker's consumer backlog (``num_pending`` +
``num_ack_pending``) before dispatching and returns HTTP 429 when it has
reached the limit. Unset / 0 keeps the pure core-NATS path unchanged.

Two request timeouts (either expiring => 504 + the request's inbox is published
to ``infera.cancel.<worker>`` (resent a few times); the worker cancels the
matching in-flight proxy task, tearing down the engine connection so it stops
generating; the same cancel fires on client disconnect):

  - IDLE (inactivity / stall): ``INFERA_NATS_REQ_IDLE_TIMEOUT`` (seconds,
    default 900) bounds the wait for the *next* reply chunk. Reset on every
    chunk, so a steadily-streaming long request never trips it; only a stall
    does. NOT an overall deadline. 0 = off.

  - TOTAL (overall): ``INFERA_NATS_REQ_MAX_DURATION`` (seconds, default 0 =
    OFF) caps the whole request's wall-clock regardless of token flow — for
    runaway / very long requests. Enforced router-side (interrupt + 504 + no
    result) and worker-side (hard local abort, also a backstop for a lost
    cancel signal).
