"""Data-parallel attention: the axis MLA serving is actually deployed on.

Tensor parallelism shards a GQA model's KV cache because it shards KV heads.
MLA has no KV heads to shard -- it caches one compressed latent that every head
reads -- so tensor parallelism replicates it, and at TP=8 a DeepSeek-style model
stores the same cache eight times over. Data-parallel attention is what fixes
that: a rank owns a subset of the running requests and holds their whole cache,
so the replica stores each sequence once.

Without this axis the projector cannot answer the capacity question for the way
these models are really served, and would answer it eight times too pessimistically.
