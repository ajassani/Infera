"""The serving search has to be able to propose the disaggregated shape these
models are actually served in.

A knob the tuner cannot express is a configuration it will silently rule out,
and disaggregation was ruled out three times over. The one split the plan
derived asked for ``max(TP)`` GPUs on the prefill pool and then a decode pool on
top, which on a single node needs nine GPUs out of eight: illegal, and dropped
by ``add()`` without a word, so a one-node search never priced the topology at
all. On two nodes it became legal but sat at position 297 of 307 against a
default seed budget of 12, so it was still never scored. And no candidate
anywhere carried both ``disaggregate`` and an attention-DP degree, because the
trial config had no per-pool field and ``mk()`` defaults the global one to 1.

That last one is what made the gap expensive rather than merely incomplete.
GLM-5.2 and DeepSeek-V4 both cache a single latent that every head reads, which
tensor parallelism *replicates* rather than shards -- so a TP8 decode pool at
attention-DP 1 stores the same cache eight times, and the decode pool's
concurrency ceiling, the whole reason to disaggregate, was understated
eightfold. The search was choosing between colocated configurations that got
data-parallel attention and a disaggregated one that could not.
